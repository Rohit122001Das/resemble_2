    "Q1. How does bagging reduce overfitting in decision trees?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS>\n",
    "\n",
    "   Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) is an ensemble technique that reduces overfitting in decision trees by introducing randomness and diversity \n",
    "   into the training process. \n",
    "\n",
    "   It achieves this through the following mechanisms:\n",
    "        \n",
    "   1> Bootstrap Sampling: In bagging, multiple bootstrapped samples (random samples with replacement) are created from the original training\n",
    "                          dataset. Each bootstrapped sample is used to train a separate decision tree. By generating different datasets through\n",
    "                          bootstrapping, each decision tree gets exposed to slightly different subsets of the data. This randomness helps reduce \n",
    "                          the chance of individual trees overfitting to specific noise or outliers present in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2> Reduced Variance: Overfitting often arises from high variance, where models become too sensitive to small fluctuations in the training data.\n",
    "                        Bagging reduces variance by averaging the predictions of multiple decision trees, which tend to have different errors due \n",
    "                        to their exposure to different subsets of data. This ensemble averaging smooths out individual errors and leads to more \n",
    "                        stable predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "   3> Model Averaging: In bagging, predictions from multiple decision trees are averaged for regression tasks or voted upon for classification\n",
    "                       tasks. The ensemble prediction tends to be less sensitive to individual noisy predictions, further reducing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "   4> Combating Biases: Decision trees have a tendency to become biased towards the training data, especially when they are deep and complex. \n",
    "                        Bagging encourages each decision tree to learn from a different subset of the data, which can help to alleviate bias by\n",
    "                        exposing each tree to different aspects of the data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "   5> Aggregate Consensus: By combining the outputs of multiple trees, bagging enforces a sort of \"wisdom of the crowd\" effect. When individual\n",
    "                           trees make mistakes due to overfitting, these mistakes are often balanced out by other trees that learned different \n",

    "\n",
    "   6> Out-of-Bag (OOB) Samples: Since each bootstrap sample leaves out around 37% of the original data, these \"out-of-bag\" samples can be used \n",
    "                                for validation. This provides a form of cross-validation that helps in estimating the model's performance and \n",
